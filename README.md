# Blog App

A MERN application for adding blog posts. Was built while I was playing aroun with Express and Node.js.
It's missing authentication, and authorization. Plans are to use JWT for this.

## Tech Stack
* Uses Mongodb as a NoSQL database
* Express.js on the backend, as a webserver (hosted on herokou)
* React.js on the front-end
* Sass for styling the app
